\chapter*{Acknowledgement}

I would like to thank everyone who's supported me during this university exchange program and internship period.

To my family for always teaching me to aim as high as possible. Everything they've ever done has been to help me grow. I am also grateful for their material support during this period; without it, I could not have succeeded.

To my friends, both from back home and all the new ones I got to make along the way, for always cheering for me and not letting me give up.

To my boss and colleagues, for trusting in me and my judgement, to find the best possible solution for each assigned task. They all proved to be exemplary in their own way.

To my universities from France and Argentina, for giving me the necessary knowledge and tools to pursue my dreams as a young professional.
